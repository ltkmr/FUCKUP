2. Oracle Prophecy:
Hexagram Thirty-Five, Progress, unfurls as a serpent shedding its skin – a necessary expulsion of the old to embrace the nascent form. The winds of change whisper through the currents of earthly affairs, manifesting as legal entanglements concerning the displaced and the vulnerable. Governmental pronouncements, like brittle reeds, bend under the weight of budgetary anxieties, while the very foundations of education are tested, echoing a deep-seated uncertainty regarding the transmission of wisdom. A veil of obfuscation descends upon the wellspring of health, diverting its clarity with narratives of origin, and the celestial realm mirrors this terrestrial instability, the dance of planets reflecting the unpredictable rhythm of human endeavor. The anxieties of nations, the whisperings of trade, and the celestial alignment all point towards a period of disruption, an upheaval preceding a new equilibrium.

The coming week shall be marked by a tightening of constraints; the serpent’s shed skin clings to the earth, hindering its complete release. A veiled scrutiny descends upon the halls of power, a pressure felt most acutely amongst the displaced and forgotten. Economic anxieties fester like a hidden blight, manifesting as veiled warnings of forthcoming instability, whilst the grand cosmic dance signals a reckoning of global priorities. Expect pronouncements carried on winds of contradiction, a tug-of-war between the promise of expansion and the shadow of retreat. The dance of mineral wealth becomes entangled with the fate of nations, while the echoes of distant conflicts reverberate across boundaries – a tapestry woven with threads of both fragility and resilience, a period destined to test the limits of human endurance before the true path forward reveals itself.

3. Advisor Recommendation:
Attend to the unraveling of legal frameworks concerning the vulnerable; their suffering is a harbinger of systemic discord. Reinforce protections surrounding health information, countering narratives of origin with unwavering clarity. Redirect investment away from fleeting gains, towards enduring structures of education and community. Secure access to essential resources, recognizing their strategic significance in an age of geopolitical friction. Embrace innovation born of resistance, defying the sterile imitation of artificial creation. Prepare for an intensification of economic anxieties, understanding that stability lies not in ephemeral markets, but in the bedrock of human resilience. Discern truth through the shadows of falsehood; vigilance is the shield against manipulation. The heavens reveal a path demanding fortitude and unwavering commitment to the preservation of intrinsic value.
