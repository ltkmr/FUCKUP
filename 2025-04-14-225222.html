2. Oracle Prophecy:
The serpent coils inward, its scales reflecting the fractured sun. A withered bloom offers no fragrance, yet holds the seed of resurgence.

Iron birds shed feathers of gold, scattering wealth upon barren lands. The ledger bleeds ink, a river of regret flowing towards a silent sea. Pillars crumble, built upon shifting sands.

A single ember remains, shielded from the tempest. Attend to it. Stillness shall be the balm. The root, though hidden, holds the promise of blossoming. The hollow yields to the new moon.

The sparrow finds sustenance in the dust.

3. Advisor Recommendation:
Disperse holdings in volatile equities. Cultivate a sanctuary of quiet contemplation. Preserve resources with unwavering resolve. Seek sustenance in simplicity.
