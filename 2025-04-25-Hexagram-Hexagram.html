<pre>In terms of conspiratorial patterns or correlations, one possible angle could be exploring connections between rising economic nationalism and trade wars around the globe, leading to increased demand for commercial space travel as a means of international transport and escape. Additionally, analyzing the influence of high-profile figures like Katy Perry and Jeff Bezos in driving advancements in space technology may offer insights into how public opinion and private enterprise intersect in today&#x27;s rapidly changing world.</pre>
