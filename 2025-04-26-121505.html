Meanwhile, social media platforms like Instagram are playing a role in popularizing traditional Jewish baking practices beyond their original ultra-orthodox context.

Another notable theme is related to Pope Francis' health and the impact on the Catholic Church. After recovering from double pneumonia that left him hospitalized for a month, Pope Francis delegated the reading of Easter Mass to a cardinal due to his recovery progress.

In terms of global society's reaction to recent events, we see that Freddie Gray's death has prompted Baltimore's Sandtown-Winchester neighborhood to work towards hope and healing. Additionally, the Justice Department under Attorney General Pam Bondi is revoking Biden-era protections for reporters in leak investigations, causing concern among journalists.

Furthermore, international students' legal status will be restored for now after several lawsuits were filed against the Trump administration attempting to block school diversity efforts. Lastly, Australian twins Bridgette and Paula Powers have gained viral attention for speaking in sync while dedicating themselves to animal conservation.

Overall, these information clusters illustrate the growing influence of technology on society, health concerns within religious institutions, and societal reactions to political decisions impacting education and environmental conservation efforts.
