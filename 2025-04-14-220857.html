==========================================

Hexagram #24: Return (The Turning Point) ䷗
Meaning: Renewal, new beginnings, return to the source.

------------------------------------------
1. Analyst Summary:
Analysis reveals key patterns including record Dow Jones highs, retaliatory Chinese tariffs, growing investor concern about slowing global growth, ongoing trade war uncertainty, rising US corporate debt, geopolitical tensions from targeted energy firms, historical reminders of the 2008 financial crisis, volatility in emerging markets, and a shift towards stock buybacks over future investments by Corporate America. These elements collectively suggest a market environment marked by both record achievements and heightened stress, particularly concerning economic conditions and strategic shifts within the business community.

2. Oracle Prophecy:
The gilded serpent coils, its scales reflecting a false sun. Stone blooms where waters once flowed. A harvest of echoes ripples across the plains of plenty. The bronze gate creaks, a promise of return, yet the path behind is strewn with shadows of forgotten debts. The lion’s roar is muted, swallowed by the whispering winds of reckoning. Let the merchants count their treasures, for the tide turns against the hoard. The eagle falters, its flight burdened by the weight of mirrored illusions. The roots seek the deep earth, but the soil remembers a bitter frost. The wheel completes its measure.

3. Advisor Recommendation:
Divest holdings of all equities exhibiting unsustainable growth predicated on artificial inflation. Embrace assets anchored in tangible resources and demonstrable utility.
