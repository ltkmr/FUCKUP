<pre>2. Oracle Prophecy:</pre>
<pre>The Abysmal descends, a churning void where waters of destiny swirl. The lineaments of the world reflect the hexagram’s truth: a perilous current shapes the land. The orphan&#x27;s plea echoes through the corridors of power, a symbol of belonging fractured and redefined. The serpent sleeps within the earth, its coils tightened by the ambitions of nations – whispers of fire rise from ancient stones, balanced precariously upon the slender thread of diplomatic discourse. Gold flows like a poisoned river, tempting nations to betray their foundations for fleeting advantage. The firmament reveals a nascent life, a mirror held to our own fragility, whilst the blood of the mortal world diminishes under skies of unpredictable wrath. The ascent of the first to hold a seat of influence is a token of the path forward, though shadowed by the judgements cast upon those who navigate the halls of commerce.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>The coming week shall witness the fracturing of oaths, the tremor of hidden agreements. The shadow of the serpent shall lengthen, reaching across oceans to darken the sun. The scales shall tip, and the voice of the one who sleeps shall be heard, though cloaked in the guise of counsel. A bargain struck beneath a dying star shall prove bitter to the tongue of those who ratify it, and the rivers will surge with a fevered heat. The heavens may unveil a truth too profound to bear, a glimpse into the endless void. The earth will yield its secrets to the insatiable hunger of those who seek dominion, and the weight of debt shall press heavy upon the shoulders of the many.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>3. Advisor Recommendation:</pre>
<pre>Secure documentation establishing citizenship and familial ties with utmost diligence. Fortify alliances with nations demonstrating independent foreign policy, insulating against the fluctuations of transactional diplomacy. Restrict exposure to financial instruments predicated on speculative growth, prioritizing preservation of capital above fleeting returns. Invest in infrastructure and resource management capable of adapting to unpredictable environmental volatility. Discern the motivations underlying pronouncements emanating from figures of political and corporate authority, recognizing the potential for concealed agendas. Acknowledge the profound implications of extraterrestrial discovery, dedicating resources to both scientific investigation and ethical deliberation. Prioritize principles of equitable resource distribution and sustainable development to mitigate the consequences of escalating global debt. Prepare for trials.</pre>
