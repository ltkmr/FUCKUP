<pre>2. Oracle Prophecy:</pre>
<pre>The hexagram *Da You* – Possession in Great Measure – unfolds as a tapestry woven with threads of cosmic grandeur and earthly burden. It speaks of a moment ripe with potential, a vessel overflowing with the gifts of the spheres. Yet, the shadow of excess clings to this bounty; the fullness threatens to spill, dissolving into chaos should wisdom falter. The ascent of the maiden towards the stars, borne aloft by the breath of human ingenuity, is but a fleeting glimpse of the celestial dance. The roar of the engines masks the whispers of ancient sorrow, a dissonance echoing from the shattered stone of hospitals and the displaced hearts of those touched by conflict. The fullness of the harvest is a deceptive visage, for the winds of discord carry seeds of famine and despair. The markets tremble, reflecting the instability of the foundations upon which they are built.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>The coming week shall witness a darkening of the silver path. The stars, though bright, shall cast long, unsettling shadows. A tremor shall run through the coffers of nations, exposing vulnerabilities long concealed. Disputes will ignite in the East, drawing the gaze of those who crave dominion. A veil of uncertainty will cling to the heavens, obscuring the true path of celestial events. A sense of fractured reality will permeate the waking world, prompting introspection and challenging the perceived order. The dance of fortunes will shift, favoring those attuned to the subtle currents, those who recognize the ephemeral nature of all things.</pre>
<pre></pre>
<pre>3. Advisor Recommendation:</pre>
<pre>Acknowledge the ascent, but temper ambition. Redirect resources from ventures of personal triumph toward humanitarian relief, specifically focusing on the regions afflicted by conflict and displacement. Maintain vigilance regarding financial instruments; divest from ventures predicated on unsustainable growth and prioritize stability. Seek counsel from those versed in the language of the stars, but heed not interpretations that promise effortless elevation. Embrace austerity; recognize that true wealth resides not in abundance, but in resilience. The rhythm of the cosmos demands balance; restore it.</pre>
